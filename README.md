# RESTGate

## The Cloud-Native L-7 Gateway to Seamless API Integration ðŸš€

--- 

## Features:

- Minimalism: 6 Golang files only
- Cloud-Native: RESTGate is engineered from the ground up for seamless integration into Kubernetes clusters. It
  specializes in intelligent ingress management and optimized routing for RESTful API traffic
- Battle-Tested: It has proven its resilience, reliability by serving world-dependent platforms that are both traffic
  intensive and computationally intensive
- Blazingly Fast: RESTGate offers low-latency and high-throughput capabilities to meet the most demanding API routing
  needs. Say goodbye to bottlenecks.
- Production-Ready: A few clicks are all it takes to make RESTGate work like magic in your cluster.

## Pre-Requisite

RESTGate requires just a single environment variable: `RESTGATE_CONFIG_PATH`. This variable specifies the path to a YAML
configuration file, which both configures RESTGate and defines the services and routes to which RESTGate will direct
traffic.

## example yaml file:

```
port: 7000
observed_services:
  - name: account-service
    service_url: "http://account-service:8000"
    routes:
      - name: account_service_health_check
        methods: "GET,OPTIONS"
        pattern: "/account-service/healthz"
        
      - name: create_new_account
        methods: "POST,OPTIONS"
        description: "create a new account."
        pattern: "/account"

      - name: get_account_info
        methods: "GET,OPTIONS"
        description: "get information about an account."
        pattern: "/account"

      - name: update_account
        methods: "POST,OPTIONS"
        description: "update an account's information."
        pattern: "/account"

      - name: delete_account
        methods: "DELETE,OPTIONS"
        description: "delete an account."
        pattern: "/account"

  - name: project-service
    service_url: "http://localhost:8002"
    routes:
      - name: project_service_health_check
        methods: "GET,OPTIONS"
        pattern: "/project-service/healthz"

      - name: create_new_project
        methods: "POST,OPTIONS"
        description: "create a new project."
        pattern: "/project"

      - name: get_project_info
        methods: "GET,OPTIONS"
        description: "get information about a project."
        pattern: "/project"

      - name: update_project
        methods: "POST,OPTIONS"
        description: "update a project's information."
        pattern: "/project"

      - name: delete_project
        methods: "DELETE,OPTIONS"
        description: "delete a project."
        pattern: "/project"
```

## yaml file explanation:

```
port: 7000 # the port RESTGate will be running on
observed_services: # the microservices running in your k8s cluster
  - name: account-service # microservice name, no specific requirements, it serves like a comment purpose
    service_url: "http://account-service:8000" # this following k8s DNS convention
    routes: # RESTFUL API routes
      - name: account_service_health_check # name for this API route, no specific requirements, it serves like a comment purpose
        methods: "GET,OPTIONS" # comma-separated api route methods
        pattern: "/account-service/healthz" # this implies, there's http://account-service:8000/account-service/healthz route available 
```

## If you doubt it, dockerise it!

1, prepare your `RESTGate.yaml`

2, build the docker image:

```
docker build --build-arg RESTATE_CONFIG_PATH=/etc/RESTGate/RESTGate.yaml -t restgate:latest .  
```

3, run the docker image

```
docker run -v whatever/your/path/to/RESTGate.yaml:/etc/RESTGate/RESTGate.yaml -p 7000:7000 restgate:latest
```

^^^ this mounts your prepared `RESTGate.yaml` to `/etc/RESTGate/RESTGate.yaml` inside the container, and assumes you
specified RESTGate running port `7000` in `RESTGate.yaml`

## Let's get it rolling into k8s cluster!

I will provide some example k8s manifest YAML files, but feel free to modify, custom and adapt to fit into your use
cases :)

1, define `restgate-service.yaml`:

```
apiVersion: v1
kind: Service
metadata:
  name: restgate
  namespace: default
spec:
  selector:
    run: restgate
  type: NodePort
  ports:
    - protocol: TCP
      port: 80
      targetPort: 7000
```

2,

```
kubectl apply -f restgate-service.yaml
```

3, provision RESTGate.yaml as a config map in k8s cluster:

```
kubectl create configmap restgate-config --from-file=whatever/your/path/to/RESTGate.yaml
```

3, define `restgate-deployment.yaml`:

```
apiVersion: apps/v1
kind: Deployment
metadata:
  name: restgate
  namespace: default
spec:
  selector:
    matchLabels:
      run: restgate
  template:
    metadata:
      labels:
        run: restgate
    spec:
      containers:
          image: .../restgate:latest # docker image registry URI to previously built docker image
          imagePullPolicy: Always
          name: restgate
          ports:
            - containerPort: 7000
              protocol: TCP
          volumeMounts:
            - mountPath: /etc/RESTGate/RESTGate.yaml
              name: restgate-config
```

4,

```
kubectl apply -f restgate-deployment.yaml
```

5, hook up with your ingress!

`restgate-ingress.yaml`:

```
apiVersion: networking.k8s.io/v1
kind: Ingress
metadata:
  name: restgate-ingress
spec:
  defaultBackend:
    service:
      name: restgate
      port:
        number: 80
```

then:

```
kubectl apply -f restgate-ingress.yaml
```
